# NFTify

## Summary
NFTify is a fun landing page that was fueled by the explosion of NFTs during August 2021.

Looking back on my path into Front-End Web Development, I too quickly glossed over pure HTML and CSS and specifically responsive design because I wanted to get to the juicy, logic heavy JS as soon as I possibly could. As a result, my design skills and basic site architecture were severely lacking. After completing my big React project, I went back and really dug into HTML and CSS and responsive design concept making great use of [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges until I could confidently build a Landing Page from scratch.

### What I Learned
1. The use of mixins to easily create design breakpoints when needed within a nested SASS structure.
2. Using BEM architecture when creating the HTML skeleton, and how it works with SASS
3. Mobile (hamburger) menu design and functionality
4.  Really understanding how the position property and ::before and ::after pseudo selectors work and best use cases.

### Built Using
1. HTML
2. CSS / SASS
3. JS

## Design Work and Inspiration
Before touching code, I like to make use of a moodboard and design program like Adobe XD to plan my attack.
